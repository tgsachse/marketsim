# marketsim
This simple CLI simulates changes in the stock market and allows users to buy and sell (fake) stocks. This software was created for an excuse to gain more practice with quasi-objects in C.

# usage
To download, clone this repository using `git` like this:
```
git clone https://www.github.com/tgsachse/marketsim.git
```
To use, run the `run.sh` script like so:
```
./run.sh
```
The simulator uses the portfolio and market files in `data` by default. Feel free to make modifications to these data files.
